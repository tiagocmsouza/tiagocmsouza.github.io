This website contains notes on applied work that I find interesting as well as intuitive (as much as possible) explanation of mathematics and statistics of topics that I used to just accept.

I am an economist curious about applied work in my area, with a view that Economics is a social science capable of providing an explanation to a broad range of themes. 

Thinking about the mechanisms to make sense of our world is my passion, but I find it crucial to make sure you have empirial evidence to ratify that mechanics.

That explains my willigness to learn programming languages, but do not explain why I still love to undestand the intuition behind theoretical mathematics and statistics.
