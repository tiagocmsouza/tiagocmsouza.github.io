This is a personal statement about what makes me love economics so deeply.

The most important lesson I learned a few years ago is that Economics studies people, how they behave and how we economists, as social scientists, can establish the main drivers of behavior.

Economics is about weighing benefits and costs, but the cost is not ncessarily the price announced or the one you see on the shelves.

We often rely on models to reach conclusions, but there are two dimensions that economists should pay special attention before making bold statments. The first layer is to ask how a model is suited to understand the problem at hand, if it contains the correct drivers of behavior. Without that, one might be looking at the weather to determine what people will watch on television (it might even have an influence, but does that determine a non-negligible fraction of behavior?). However, even understanding the main drivers of cahnges in behavior, an economist should always give a second step and question whether there are other aspects of life influencing people's choices in that particular setting. In other words, must be aware of the limitations that a model has in providing guidance to understand behavior and serve as a guidance to policy.
