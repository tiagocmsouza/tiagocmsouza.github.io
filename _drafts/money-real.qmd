### Closed Economy

Inflation is necessary to transfer real resources from Money holders to Money issuers.

If production falls, inflation rises because the same amount of Money commands access fewer real assets and their nominal value increases.


### Open Economy

The exchange rate represents how much goods can be traded across regions.

If production falls in one region, that region commands fewer real assets and their nominal value must rise with respect to another region via an exchange rate depreciation.

It is also important to think the relationship between inflation and exchange rate depreciations.
