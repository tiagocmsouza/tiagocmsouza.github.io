People produce goods and services and demand goods and services.

To make things simple, assume a market in equilibrium. So everyone's production can be valued which implies in an income for that period.

The idea here is that money approximates ex-post demand to ex-ante demand, and that would be its usefulness.

It is as if all goods serve as money in general equilibirum, since any good can be used as numeraire.

Ex-ante demand is the demand people would have for goods if they could make all the transactions necessary to maximize utility. Therefore, it assumes that all others would be willing to accept an amount of a person's production in exchange for some of their own production.

However, you cannot guarantee that, only that others would accept trading with a person with some probability. So, ex-post demand is the result of a realization of a distribution of possible outcomes with respect to people's willingness to transact. Ex-ante demand, the maximum to be attained, would be one of the many possible outcomes in ex-post demand.

Ex-ante demand is one point while ex-post demand is a ditribution. Money would make it possible to lower the dispersion of the distribution and make it more contrated around the optimal ex-ante demand choice, as more transactions would become occuer. Indeed, when all transactions take place, the utility level fo ex-ante demand is attained.
