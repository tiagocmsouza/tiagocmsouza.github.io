The field of optimization can be unified by a few geometric principles of linear vector space theory (functional analysis), which convey enough insight to solve complex infinite-dimensional problems.

But functional analysis should not be feared, as most of its main results are expressed as abstractions of intuitive geometric properties of finite-dimensional spaces. Once this intuition is build, it widens the range of problems that optimization theory can be applied.
